{"name":"Hlib","tagline":"HLib - An arm-based hardware library","body":"### Introduction\r\nThe aim of this project is to build up an eco-system for applying embedded system into real world. The eco-system includes an open hardware library, an open software library, and a community of engineers, researchers, and students.\r\n\r\nThe most important point that makes this project differ others is standardization. The project standardizes connector interface, connector layout, and board mechanical specification. All hardware designs have to comply with these specifications in order to form a compatible hardware library. In addition, a standardized software library are developed concurrently. This ensures every board can plug and play. Consequently, users using HLib only think about their applications and add-in value. They do not need concert with hardware design, hardware compatible, hardware abstract layer any more. Is it amazing idea of HLib.\r\n\r\n### Developing\r\nIn first phase, main purpose of the project is to support developing of embedded system in Department of Computer Engineering, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (DCE-HCMUT). Basis MBoards, EBoards and their software libraries are designed by lecturers and students of DCE-HCMUT. These boards are used in students' projects, thesis, and researches freely in laboratory. DCE will corporate with companies to make special discount program so that student can own these boards. They can also make these board by themselves with open hardware provided. Lecturers may use these board for fast prototype in their projects also. \r\n\r\n### Platform\r\nThe core developer team select ARM architecture for MBoard. ARM has strong computation, lot of peripheral, and low power consumption. In our vision, it will replace 8-bit and 16-bit MCU/MPU and become universal MCU/MPU in near future.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nAll the hardwares and softwares of HLib are open access. Using, developing,  commercializing, or getting profit form HLib must complying with NonCommercial-ShareAlike Common Creative License.\r\n\r\n### If you want to join, please contact us\r\nBui Van Hieu\r\n\r\nEmail: bvhieu@cse.hcmut.edu.vn\r\n\r\nBlock A3, Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology\r\n\r\n268 Ly Thuong Kiet Street, District 10, Ho Chi Minh City","google":"HLib","note":"Don't delete this file!
